# SELF TRIAGE APP 

Overall Functionality:

Backend (Java Spring Boot/H2 Database): Exposes a REST API where a symptom can be sent, and corresponding medical advice is returned. It also initializes some sample data in the repository.

Frontend (HTML/JS/CSS/Bootstrap): Users see a welcome screen and can click "Get Started" to display a form. They describe their symptom, submit the form, and see corresponding advice typed out on the screen. There's also a placeholder login modal, although login functionality hasn't been fully implemented as this a MVP.
